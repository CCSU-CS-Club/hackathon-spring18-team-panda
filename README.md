# The Hartford Insurance App
This app is built for customers holding renters' insurance policies. It enables them to upload and store images and information about their valuables.
## Getting Started
Clone the repository to a machine running XAMP (Apache, PHP, MySQL).
### Installing on Ubuntu 16.04
```
1. sudo apt-get install apache2
2. sudo apt-get install mysql-server
3. sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mcrypt php-mysql
4. sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
To use the app, take a photo of the valuable item. Log into the web app, and you will see a list of your valuable items. You can then upload a new item, delete an item, or edit the description of an item.
